# Dart Language Learning Project

This project is designed to help you master the Dart programming language through practical examples, following clean code principles and best practices.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into modules, each focusing on specific Dart concepts:

### 1. Classes and Object-Oriented Programming
- `classes/` - Examples of class definitions, constructors, and OOP concepts
  - `test_class.dart` - Basic class structure and cascade notation
  - `person.dart` - Factory constructors and object caching
  - `fraction.dart` - Named and redirecting constructors
  - `colors.dart` - Enums and factory constructors with caching
  - `vehlice.dart` - Inheritance and factory methods

### 2. Functions
- `function_recap/` - Various function types and implementations
  - `function_recap.dart` - Function declarations, arrow syntax, and callbacks

### 3. Asynchronous Programming
- `async/` - Futures, async/await, and Stream examples

### 4. Collections and Generics
- `collections/` - Lists, Maps, Sets, and generic types

### 5. Error Handling
- `error_handling/` - Try/catch blocks, custom exceptions

### 6. Dart Best Practices
- `best_practices/` - Code organization, naming conventions, documentation

## Learning Path

This project follows a structured learning path:

1. **Basic Syntax and OOP** - Start with classes and object-oriented concepts
2. **Functions and Functional Programming** - Learn various function types and patterns
3. **Collections and Generics** - Master data structures and generic programming
4. **Asynchronous Programming** - Understand Futures, async/await, and Streams
5. **Error Handling** - Implement robust error handling strategies
6. **Best Practices** - Apply clean code principles and documentation standards

## Git Workflow

The project uses Git branches to organize different learning modules:

- `main` - Stable, working code
- `feature/oop` - Object-oriented programming examples
- `feature/functions` - Function implementations
- `feature/async` - Asynchronous programming
- `feature/collections` - Collection types and operations
- `feature/error-handling` - Error handling patterns
- `feature/best-practices` - Clean code and documentation

## How to Use This Project

Explore each module in sequence, reading the documentation and comments that explain the concepts. Run the examples to see Dart in action and experiment with modifications to deepen your understanding.

```bash
# Run the main example file
dart run main.dart

# Run specific module examples
dart run function_recap/function_recap.dart
```

## Documentation Standards

All code in this project follows these documentation standards:

- **File Headers** - Purpose and author information
- **Class Documentation** - Class purpose and usage examples
- **Method Documentation** - Parameters, return values, and examples
- **Code Comments** - Explanations for complex logic

This consistent documentation makes the code more maintainable and easier to understand.
